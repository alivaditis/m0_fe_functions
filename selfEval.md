# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    I'm proud that I was able to use a little bit more advanced logic, these were more challenging.  I struggled for a while to find a way to return and print a string with spaces in between the parameters. 
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    Functions enable the engineer to create succinct, logical methods to execute a specific task in the code.
